This package contains several simple tools for use with Git.

The tools have been written by Martin Mares <mj@ucw.cz> and put
into the public domain.

== update2 ==

This is a somewhat sophisticated Perl script for sending of commit
logs by e-mail whenever new commits are pushed to a Git repository.
Just make your update hook call:

	$GIT_TOOLS/update2 --mail-to="you@example.net" "$@"

Beside normal commits, the script should recognize creations and
deletions of branches and also rewinding and rebasing.

== update ==

This is a previous incarnation of the update script.
